## How to contribute to Koloda

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/Yalantis/Koloda/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Yalantis/Koloda/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **example project** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Fill appropriate section in issue template and remove the section you aren't interested in.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
 
* Ensure the PR doesn't extend the number of existing issues.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are **cosmetic** in nature and **do not add anything substantial** to the stability or functionality of Koloda will generally **not be accepted**.

#### **Did you write patch that extends functionality?**

* Ensure the functionality you trying to add needed not only for your case.

#### Each issue will be labeled by it's `type`, `priority` and `status`.

**Issue types:**
* Bug
* Enhancement

**These are the available priority labels:**
* Critical
* High
* Medium
* Low

**Status label will be assigned to your issue to keep the issue tracker easy to follow:**
* Queued (will be reviewed soon)
* Reviewed (assignee has read it)
* Pending (will work on it soon)
* Work in progress (is working on it now)
* On hold
* Invalid (if bug it's not reproducible)
* Need feedback (signal to get people to read and comment or provide help)

#### **Coding Style**

* Most importantly, match the existing code style as much as possible.

#### **Do you have a question?**

For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.
